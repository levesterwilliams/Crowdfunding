* INSTRUCTIONS TO START APP

To edit/view/delete/add organizations and contributions from the browser, 
make sure to navigate to the admin folder and run the admin.js to launch port 3000, then open the webApp.
Otherwise, you can access an organization to view or add funds from from the console. To do this, 
navigate to the admin folder and run api.js to lauch port 3001. We changed the login and password variables 
in the Main() function from "test" and "test" to "args[0]" and "args[1]", respectively. 
You can either add the login and password of your organization as command line arguments when you run the file, 
or you can add your login and password as runtime variables in the run configurations of UserInterface.java.
To start the app, run UserInterface.java.

* TEAM MEMBER CONTRIBUTION DESCRIPTIONS *

* Task 1.1: We added test cases in DataManager_createFund_test and created test classes
 			to test DataManager.attemptLogin() and DataManager.getConrtibutorName() methods in
 			AttemptLoginTest.java and GetContributorNameTest.java, respectively to receive 100%
 			satement coverage for DataManger.java.
 			 
* Task 1.2: BUG: In the createFund method in the UserInterface class, the JSONObject.get() with the key, 
			“descrption”, passed within the first if-statement was misspelled: we changed it to “description”.
			 No other obvious bugs were found. Tests currently pass with 100% coverage.
			 
* Task 1.3:  In the displayFund method in the UserInterface class we initialized two new local long variables donations_sum and donations_percent to 0. 
			 Within the for loop we added the donation amount to the donations sum. 
			 After the for loop we multiplied the donation sum * 100 / target sum to calculate the donations_percent. 
			 Finally we created a new line of code to print the donations_sum and donations_percent.

* Task 1.7: There are three checks of error handling in the start() function. 
			An error will be thrown if 1) the user enters a number less than 0, 
			2) the user enters a number greater than the current fund list, and 
			3) the user doesn’t enter a number at all, e.g. a letter, which will throw an InputMismatchException. 
			In all three cases, the user is prompted to re-enter until the input is valid. 
			If the user passes all three checks, then a valid input is sent to the displayFund() function. 
			We added one error input check to createFund(). The user must enter a number when asked for a target amount, 
			otherwise it will prompt the user to re-enter until they enter a number.

* Task 1.8: In the displayFund method in the UserInterface class, 
			we imported two new packages: java.util.Date, java.util.List. 
			We then used the SimpleDateFormat class to create two new SimpleDateFormat objects, originalFormat and targetFormat. 
			We then updated the existing print statement to print targetFormat, 
			instead of the unformatted date that was originally present in that statement.
