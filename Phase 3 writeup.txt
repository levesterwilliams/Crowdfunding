* Task 3.3: Abby
** I created a new method in UserInterface called updateNameDesc() to allow the user to update the org name and org description,
as well as a helper method called checkPassword() to check the userâ€™s password before allowing them to make changes to the org object.
** I created a new method in DataManager called updateOrgName() which updates an organization using the /updateOrg endpoint in the API.
l also created test cases for that new method in a file called UpdateOrgNameDescTest.
** I updated the RESTFUL API to add a method called updateOrgName() to update the name and description for a given org id in mongoDB.
