* TEAM MEMBER CONTRIBUTION DESCRIPTIONS *

* Task 3.1: 
 			 
* Task 3.2: Levester
- In api.js, we created an endpoint "/updateOrgPassword" in api.js wherein the organization's ID and new password are passed to the server and password is updated only if no errors occurred and status is "success."
- In DataManager.java, we created a new method called updatePassword() that takes as an argument String id, the organization's id, and String password, the new password. The arguments id and password are sent to the server using RESTful AI with the endpoint "/updateOrgPassword". If "status".equals("success"), the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. If id and password are null, IllegalArgumentExceptions are thrown. If errors occuring during sending or parsing the JSON object, IllegalStateException is thrown.
- In Organization.java, we added a new private instance field, String password, and public getter and setters to retreive and set the org's password.
- In UserInterface.java, we added a public method called updatePassowrd() that returns true if the password was successfully updated and false if not. Within that method, the user is prompted to enter their current password. If entered incorrectly or the input is null, the method returns false. If entered correctly, the user is prompted to type in their new password twice. If the inputs are null, do not match, or are both blanks, then the method returns false. Otherwise, the method invokes on the DataManager object updatePassword() and pass the org's id and new password. If that method invocation return true, then the Organization.setPassword() is invoked to set the new password and the method returns true. If not, return false. For each step if false is returned, an appropriate error message is printed. 
- In UserInterface.java, within the start() method, the user in the main menu can type "-2" to change their password and updatePassowrd() method is called. If it return true, a statment indicating success is printed; otherwise, a statement indicating failure is printed.
			 
* Task 3.3: Abby
** I created a new method in UserInterface called updateNameDesc() to allow the user to update the org name and org description,
as well as a helper method called checkPassword() to check the userâ€™s password before allowing them to make changes to the org object.
** I created a new method in DataManager called updateOrgName() which updates an organization using the /updateOrg endpoint in the API.
l also created test cases for that new method in a file called UpdateOrgNameDescTest.
** I updated the RESTFUL API to add a method called updateOrgName() to update the name and description for a given org id in mongoDB.
